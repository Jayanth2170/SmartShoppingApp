Traditional shopping methods depend heavily on manual barcode scanning during checkout, often resulting in long queues, delays, and overall inefficiencies that impact the consumer experience. To address these challenges, this project develops a Smart Shopping Cart system that leverages deep learning for automated product detection, aiming to make shopping faster and more convenient. A custom dataset of product images was carefully collected and annotated using Roboflow to capture various product appearances under different lighting conditions and angles. Using this dataset, a YOLOv6 object detection model was trained to accurately identify products in real time without requiring barcode scanning.

The trained model was then converted into ONNX format for efficient deployment and integrated into an Android application. This app enables users to scan products directly through their smartphone cameras, where detected items trigger a query to an SQLite database that stores detailed product information such as name, price, and category. By retrieving these details instantly, the app eliminates the need for manual input and speeds up the checkout process, enhancing user convenience and shopping efficiency.

The overall system architecture follows a structured workflow involving data collection, model training, model conversion, and seamless integration with mobile technology. Developed in Android Studio, the application demonstrates the practical fusion of artificial intelligence and mobile computing to automate retail checkout. This project highlights the potential of AI-driven retail solutions to reduce wait times, improve accuracy in product identification, and create smarter shopping environments. The Smart Shopping Cart thus offers a significant step toward transforming traditional retail into a more automated and user-friendly experience.
